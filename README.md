# Learning Lyapunov Functions from Data

> “My professor asked me to find a Lyapunov candidate.  
> I spent the whole afternoon and missed my date at Tivoli (amusement park in Denmark).  
> Now she says we’re over 💔.”  
> — Thomas, heartbroken but now stable

From today on, no one has to choose between **love** and **Lyapunov**:  
What used to take a heartbreak 💔 — now takes one command.


## What It Does


Given the tracking result, this repository automates the search for Lyapunov candidate.  
And it even gives us a PDF report automatically!
