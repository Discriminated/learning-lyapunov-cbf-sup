# Learning Lyapunov Functions from Data

From today on, no one has to choose between love and Lyapunov.

This repository automates the search for Lyapunov candidate functions.  
Given system trajectory data, it fits a provably stable function — and even compiles a report!

Whiteboard math? Gone.  
Blind guessing? Gone.  
Romantic tragedy? Completely avoidable.

## 💡 What It Does

- Trains a positive-definite Lyapunov function using numerical constraints
- Generates a full LaTeX `.pdf` report as certificate

What used to take a PhD, a headache, and a heartbreak — now takes one command.
