# Learning Lyapunov Functions from Data

> “My professor asked me to find a Lyapunov candidate.  
> I spent the whole afternoon and missed my date at Tivoli (amusement park in Copenhagen).  
> Now she says we’re over 💔.”  
> — Thomas, heartbroken but now stable

From today on, no one has to choose between **love** and **Lyapunov**.


## 💡 What It Does


Given system trajectory data, this repository automates the search for Lyapunov candidate functions.  
And it even gives us a PDF report automatically!

Whiteboard math?  
🧼 Gone.

Blind guessing?  
🎯 Gone.

Romantic tragedy?  
💔 Completely avoidable.

## 🧠 Features

- Trains a positive-definite Lyapunov function using numerical constraints
- Generates a full LaTeX `.pdf` report as certificate

What used to take a PhD, a headache, and a heartbreak — now takes one command.
